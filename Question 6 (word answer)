Answer: 
Static Scope: Sub 3 has a x w. Main has y z.
Dynamic Scope:  Sub 3 has a x w. Sub1 has y z.

c. main calls sub2; sub2 calls sub3; sub3 calls sub1.
Answer: 
Static Scope: Main has x, Sub1 has a,y,z. Sub2 has b. Sub3 has w.
Dynamic Scope: Sub1 has a y z, Sub3 has x w. Sub2 has b.

d. main calls sub3; sub3 calls sub1.
Answer: 
Static Scope: Sub1 has a,y,z. Sub3 has a,x,w
Dynamic Scope: Sub1 has a,y,z. Main has x. Sub3 has w.

e. main calls sub1; sub1 calls sub3; sub3 calls sub2.
Static scope: Sub1 has z. Sub2 has a,b,z. Sub3 has a,x,w.
Dynamic Scope: Main has x,y. Sub2 has a,b,z. Sub3 has w.

f. main calls sub3; sub3 calls sub2; sub2 calls sub1.
Static Scope: Sub1 has y. Sub2 has b,z. Sub3 has a,x,w.
