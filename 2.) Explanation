Static scope is also called lexical scoping. If a variable name’s scope is a certain function, then its scope is the program text of the function definition: within that text, the variable name exists, and is bound to its variable, but outside that text, the variable name does not exist.
In dynamic scoping, if a variable name’s scope is a certain function, then its scope is the time-period during which the function is executing. While the function is running, the variable name exists, and is bound to its variable, but after the function returns, the variable name does not exist.
