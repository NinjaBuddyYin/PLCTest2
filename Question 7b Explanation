The > operator associates left to right, so the in if condition works differently like if( (a>b) >c ). And this is the main problem. C does not have a boolean type. It uses int. So, a>b return 0 of int. Then, check 0<c so it is false. One true and one false then && operator gives the output 0. So, if condition not execute and else block will be executed. That's why false is printed.
