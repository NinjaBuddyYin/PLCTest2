Enum is a value type data type which is used to declare a list of named integer constants and can be defined using the enum keyword inside a class, or structure. The enum is used to give a name to each constant so that the constant integer can be called using its name. In most case enum provides a better readability than showing some integer values. Therefore it is better than the integer variables.
